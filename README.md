# Sururu


It is an open source project with a collection of libraries for iOS platform, written in Kotlin. Its goal is to help programmers with common functionalities needed daily in most projects, making developing mobile apps easier. Basically, it is a result of refactoring on projects that I have worked on. This project is integrated with [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit), providing some abstraction for methods like: pushActivity; popActivity; overridePendingTransition; There is also view components to deal with type of fonts, dialog builders and auto resize text view. You can also find utility classes for currency, date and number format. There is string validation.

## Installation

### From Gradle

If you are using [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) as your dependency manager, you can simply add [Sururu's repository](https://github.com/macksuelsantos/sururu) and its dependency in your `build.gradle` file, as the example below.

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.1.50'

    repositories {
        jcenter()
        google()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.0.0-beta6'
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-android-extensions:$kotlin_version"
        classpath "io.realm:realm-gradle-plugin:3.7.2"
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://github.com/macksuelsantos/sururu/raw/master/repo' }
        jcenter()
        google()
    }
}

task clean(type: Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
...
```

And in your `app\build.gradle` file, as the example below.
```groovy
dependencies {

    //Sururu
    implementation 'com.sururu.core:library:1.0.0'
    implementation 'com.sururu.restclient:library:1.0.0'
}
...
```

Be aware of the latest version.
